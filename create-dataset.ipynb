   A RESPECTED senior French police officer inves...\n\nName: articleBody, dtype: object\n\nA RESPECTED senior French police officer investigating the Charlie Hebdo magazine massacre took his own life mere hours after the horrific attacks stunned the world.\n\n\n\nCommissioner Helric Fredou, 45, turned a gun on himself in his police office in Limoges last Wednesday night, reported France 3.\n\n\n\nA colleague found his body at 1am on Thursday, the day after three gunmen fired at the satirical magazine's office and left 12 people dead.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to our sister publication Mirror Online, the Union of Commissioners of the National Police confirmed Mr Fredou had taken his own life.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a statement released after his death, a union spokesman said: \"It is with great sadness that we were informed this morning of the death of our colleague Helric Fredou, assigned as Deputy Director of the Regional Service Judicial Police in Limoges.\n\n\n\n\"On this particular day of national mourning, police commissioners are hit hard by the tragic death of one of their own.\n\n\n\n\"The Union of Commissioners of the National Police would like to present its most sincere condolences to the relatives of Helric.\n\n\n\n\"In these difficult times, we have a special thought for all his colleagues.\"\n\n\n\nMr Fredou - who was single and had no children - began his career as a police officer in 1997, working in Versailles.\n\n\n\nHe eventually returned to his home town of Limoges and in 2012 became deputy director of the regional police service.\n\n\n\n\n\nFrench media reports suggest he was depressed and was suffering from burnout.\n\n\n\nBrothers Said and Cherif Kouachi launched last Wednesday's devastating attack at the office's of the French satirical magazine.\n\n\n\nThe attack left 12 people dead. On Friday, the pair were shot dead by police after taking a man hostage at a family-run printing press in Dammartin-en-Goele .\n\n\n\nIn a separate incident on Friday, Amedy Coulibaly, 32, took about 15 people hostage in a Paris supermarket.\n\n\n\nFour hostages were killed in the incident along with Coulibaly.\n"}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"headline_wordcount = []\nbody_wordcount =
